                <p><b>Prehistory96: The Great Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show is literally Immense. The Greatest of All movies, and the last of their kind. No other movie will replace it not even shows of any channel will be able to compete with The Official Movie EVENT. The Ed, Edd n Eddy Big Picture Show is way more complex than any movie played on Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, or any other channel to the viewers. (Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show)Respectively deserves more than a review. Last of The Cartoon Cartoons, Last of The Fridays Shows and know the last of their kind. Cow & Chicken, I Am Weasel, Scooby Doo, Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Laboratory, Tom & Jerry, The PowerPuff Girls, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, Codename:Kids Next Door, Sameri Jack, Foster's Home for Imagenary Friends, Teen Titans, but only Ed, Edd n Eddy continued until the movie of which told it all. Absolutely no upcoming shows like Adventure Time & Generator Rex or The Regular Show. Ed, Edd n Eddy shall be missed and remember-ED. The only thing I can really complain about was the ending, which I won't reveal. I think it seemed a bit rushed. Even though it's a cartoon, I see it as unrealistic, even in the AKA-Cartooniverse. The majority of people I have talked to about the movie saw no problem with it, though, so maybe I'm just too bitter. Overall It was a nice little 90 minute trip back to my childhood. If you loved the series, you need to see this movie.</p>
                <p><b>aids-19: I was a huge "Ed, Edd n Eddy" fan when I was younger. Now I'm much older and beyond these types of cartoon. But I still had to check out this movie for the nostalgia. I loved the show when I was younger, and enjoyed the movie quite a bit. All the typical zaniness that you'd expect from the Eds and had seen in the television series, plus more, is present in the movie and very reasonably so.</p>
                <p><b>bearfaceproductions: I thought that this wouldn't be good since I thought that Ed, Edd and Eddy wouldn't make a good movie, but I was wrong. I laughed so hard the jokes and humor of the Eds. Looks like the series ends here, but it ends in an awesome way that everybody, including the fans, will be really satisfied. The movie has a great plot and its and adventure that stays true to the series. The movie is worthy of being in cinemas, everybody of any age is willing to enjoy this masterpiece. I did not expect this movie to be so good, if your an Ed, Edd and Eddy fan, do not miss this great work of cartoon art. Cartoon Network should have stayed with this show, these kind of shows are the ones that keep cartoon network with high ratings. But without the Eds, Cartoon Network is sure to fall.</p>
