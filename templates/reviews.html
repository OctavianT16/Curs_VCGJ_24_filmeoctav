    		<h2>A great movie... A pop epiphany, marking that commercially creative point where the power of Hollywood meets the purity of myth. - Rick Groen (The Globe and Mail)</h2>
    		
    		<h2>More elaborate than the original, but just as shrewdly put together, it cleverly combines the most successful elements of its predecessor with a number of new twists (would you believe a kinder, gentler Terminator?) to produce one hell of a wild ride, a Twilight of the Gods that takes no prisoners and leaves audiences desperate for mercy. - Kenneth Turan (Los Angeles Times)</h2>
    		
    		<h2>Terminator 2 imagines things you wouldn't even be likely to dream and gets these visions onto the screen with a seamlessness that's mind-boggling. - Mick LaSalle (San Francisco Chronicle)</h2>
    		
    		<h2> The key element in any action picture, I think, is a good villain. Terminator 2 has one, along with an intriguing hero and fierce heroine, and a young boy who is played by Furlong with guts and energy. - Roger Ebert (Chicago Sun-Times)</h2>
